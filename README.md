# Python Data Structures
This repository contains **educational implementations of common data structures in Python**.
While Python provides built-in versions of these structures (e.g., `list`, `dict`, `set`),
these implementations are written **from scratch for learning and practice purposes**.

The goal of this repository is to deepen understanding of:
- How data structures work internally
- Trade-offs between different implementations
- Algorithmic complexity and design choices

## Implemented Structures

- Dynamic Array
- (More to be added)

## Usage

Each data structure can be run or tested independently. Example:

python linked_list.py
